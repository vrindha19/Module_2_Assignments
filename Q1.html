    <p>What is HTML ?</p>

 

        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
        <ul>
        
           <li> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
        
           <li>HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup</li>
        
            <li>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages</li>
        
            <li>HTML elements are represented by tags</li>
        </p>
        <p>HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page</li>
            HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author â€” these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful graphical editor to create HTML pages.
